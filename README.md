# Raspberry Pi 1U Server
There are server colocation providers that allow hosting a 1U server for as low as $30/month, but there's a catch: There are restrictions on power usage (1A @ 120v max, for example) because they're expecting small and power-efficient network equipment like firewalls.

This repo is about designing a server that fits within the 1U space and 1A @ 120v power constraint while maximizing computing power, storage, and value.

## Software Setup
1. Flash an SD cart with raspbian lite and enable SSH with:
1. `cd /Volumes/boot/`
1. `touch shh`
1. Insert the SD card, boot the Pi, ssh into the Pi with `ssh pi@<ip address>`.
1. Update the firmware on the Pi to allow booting from USB:
1. `sudo apt-get update`
1. `sudo apt full-upgrade`
1. `sudo rpi-update`
1. `sudo reboot`
1. Unplug the sd card and reboot again to use the SSD via usb.
1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt full-upgrade` again with the new OS on the SSD.
1. [Disable wifi and bluetooth](https://chrisapproved.com/blog/raspberry-pi-hardening.html#disable-wireless-interfaces)
1. [Add your public key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md)
1. [Disable password authentication](https://gist.github.com/brpaz/10243211f3f7cd06cc11#file-deploy_user-sh-L14-L17)

## Hardware Setup

TODO

## Measuring Amperage
1. Plug the server into the Kill-A-Watt.
1. Press the button on the Kill-A-Watt for "amps".
1. `sudo apt-get install stress`
1. `while true; do vcgencmd measure_clock arm; vcgencmd measure_temp; sleep 10; done& stress -c 4 -t 900s`
1. Restart the server by unplugging and plugging back in. Watch the amperage on start-up.

## Improvement Ideas

### Other Colocation Options

### Other Chassis Options

* [BitScope Blade Rack](https://www.pishop.us/product/bitscope-blade-rack/)
    * Not as much room as the 1U chassis.
* [1U Raspberry Pi rack](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/my-6-node-1u-raspberry-pi-rack-mount-cluster)
    * No room for storage, power supply, and a switch to allow for consolidating ethernet connections to the single cable required by the colocation provider.
    * Doesn't match the usual network device form factor, and some colocation providers might not like this?
