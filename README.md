# Raspberry Pi 1U Server
There are server colocation providers that allow hosting a 1U server for as low as $30/month, but there's a catch: There are restrictions on power usage (1A @ 120v max, for example) because they're expecting small and power-efficient network equipment like firewalls.

This repo is about designing a server that fits within the 1U space and 1A @ 120v power constraint while maximizing computing power, storage, and value.

    * load: 0.36A 
* Total w/ blower fan on high setting:
    * idle: 0.4A @ 120V

## Software Setup
You will need to do this for each of the Raspberry Pi's:
1. [Flash an SD card with Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) (under "Raspberry Pi OS (other)" in the Raspberry Pi Imager) and enable SSH with:
    1. `cd /Volumes/boot/`
    1. `touch shh`
1. Insert the SD card into the Pi, power on, and ssh into the Pi with `ssh pi@<ip address>` and the password "raspberry".
1. Update the hostname to correspond to the number on the case:
    1. `sudo raspi-config`
    1. `1 System Options` -> `S4 Hostname` -> Update hostname -> Finish -> Reboot
1. Update the firmware on the Pi to allow booting from USB:
    1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y`
    1. `sudo rpi-update` (only do this once on each Pi)
1. [Disable wifi and bluetooth](https://chrisapproved.com/blog/raspberry-pi-hardening.html#disable-wireless-interfaces):
    1. `sudo bash -c 'echo -e "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi" >> /boot/config.txt'`
    1. `sudo bash -c 'echo -e "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt" >> /boot/config.txt'`
    1. `sudo reboot`
1. [Add your public key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) (while disconnected from the pi, with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@<IP-ADDRESS> 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'`)
1. Make sure the SSD into one of the blue USB 3 ports.
1. SSH into the Pi again and [Disable password authentication](https://gist.github.com/brpaz/10243211f3f7cd06cc11#file-deploy_user-sh-L14-L17):
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*PubkeyAuthentication /c PubkeyAuthentication yes' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*ChallengeResponseAuthentication /c ChallengeResponseAuthentication no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*PasswordAuthentication /c PasswordAuthentication no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    1. `sudo sed -i '/^#*UsePAM /c UsePAM no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
1. Configure the Pi to [prioritize booting from the SSD](https://docs.nextcloudpi.com/en/rpi4-chnage-boot-order/):
    1. `sudo raspi-config`
    1. `6 Advanced Options` -> `A6 Boot Order` -> `B2 USB Boot` -> Finish -> Reboot
    1. If you see an "No EEPROM bin file found" error, you may need to run `sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit` and add `[all] BOOT_ORDER=0xf14`.
1. Repeat the steps above (without `sudo rpi-update`) with the new OS on the SSD. SSH'ing into the new OS on the SSD may require clearing out the line with the corresponding IP in your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file.

## Hardware Setup

1. Install the Raspberry Pi's in their Flirc Cases. Make sure you put the bottom on the case before adding the screws.
1. Add labels with numbers to the tops of the cases. 
1. Cut 8x 6" lengths of standed wire, strip the ends, 
1. Start to lay out the Raspberry Pi's, switch, and power supply breakout board in the chassis. Don't plug the power supply into the wall yet.

TODO

## Remote Power Management Software
Only do this on the power management Paspberry Pi connected to the relay:
1. `curl -o relay_control.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawl/raspberry-pi-1u-server/main/relay_control.py`
1. Test the script: `python relay_control.py`

You should see the light on the SSD flash off and on for the Pi whose relay's GPIO pin you entered.

## Measuring Amperage
1. Plug the server into the Kill-A-Watt.
1. Press the button on the Kill-A-Watt for "amps".
1. `sudo apt-get install stress`
1. `while true; do vcgencmd measure_clock arm; vcgencmd measure_temp; sleep 10; done& stress -c 4 -t 900s`
1. Restart the server by unplugging and plugging back in. Watch the amperage on start-up.

## Single Points Of Failure
* Switch 
* Relay 
* Power Supply 
* Electrical Short (from loose terminal or pinched wire?)
* The Management Pi Dies (and can't powercycle the other Pi's)

### Other Colocation Options

* [webhostingtalk.com](https://www.webhostingtalk.com/forumdisplay.php?f=131)

### Other Chassis Options

* [BitScope Blade Rack](https://www.pishop.us/product/bitscope-blade-rack/)
    * Doesn't have as much room as the 1U chassis.
* [1U Raspberry Pi rack](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/my-6-node-1u-raspberry-pi-rack-mount-cluster)
    * No room for storage, power supply, and a switch to allow for consolidating ethernet connections to the single cable required by the colocation provider.
    * Doesn't match the usual server form factor, and some colocation providers might not like this?
